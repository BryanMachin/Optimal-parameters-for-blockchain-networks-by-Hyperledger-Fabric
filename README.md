# Performance Analysis in Hyperledger Fabric

Hyperledger Fabric is currently one of the most popular commercial Blockchain platforms. With the ability to run smart contracts developed in general-purpose programming languages, Fabric has become one of the most popular platforms in the enterprise arena. Among its benefits there is also a set of configurable parameters, which depending on the volume of transactions per second at which the network operates, may or may not improve its performance. For a potentially interested developer, it is not trivial to decide whether a given fabric configuration will meet the required performance expectations. Therefore, this work shows a performance analysis for Hyperledger Fabric v2.4 and focuses on offering a configuration for two possible work scenarios: low and high volumes of transactions per second. The latency metrics, along with the scalability in the platform nodes and the size of the communication channel blocks are the study variables analyzed. The results show, according to the parameters offered as candidates, for each of the proposed scenarios, a configuration that optimizes performance or minimizes average latency, depending on the needs of the network operator.
